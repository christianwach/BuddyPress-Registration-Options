# Registration Options for BuddyPress

Moderate new BuddyPress members, fight BuddyPress spam, set BuddyPress Groups or Blogs/Sites new members can join on the registration page.

This BuddyPress extension allows you to enable user moderation for new members, as well as help create a private network for your users. If moderation is enabled, any new members will be denied access to your BuddyPress and bbPress areas on your site, with the exception of their own user profile. They will be allowed to edit and configure that much. They will also not be listed in the members lists on the frontend until approved. Custom messages are available so you can tailor them to the tone of your website and community. When an admin approves or denies a user, email notifications will be sent to let them know of the decision.

Requires BuddyPress version 1.7 or higher and bbPress 2.0 or higher.

== General Data Protection Regulation

BuddyPress Registration Options temporarily stores user IP addresses as user meta to help validate and vet pending users. Saved IP values are deleted upon both approval and denial of pending user. No other personal data is recorded.
